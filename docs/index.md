# Cookiecutter ML Templates

!!! success "Latest Update"
    All templates now include integration tests and are verified to work end-to-end! ‚ú®

A curated collection of **production-ready** Cookiecutter templates designed to jumpstart Machine Learning projects with best practices baked in.

## Why This Project?

Developing ML models often involves repetitive setup and boilerplate code. Existing projects can be:

- üì¶ Outdated or poorly documented
- üéØ Too simplistic for real-world use
- üîß Lacking modern MLOps practices

**This library solves these problems** by providing:

‚úÖ **Reusable Foundations** - Clean, well-structured templates from real projects  
‚úÖ **Standardization** - Consistent structure across different ML tasks  
‚úÖ **Educational** - Clear examples with explanations of *why*  
‚úÖ **Production-Ready** - Robust starting points with testing, CI/CD, and more  
‚úÖ **Easy to Share** - Package and distribute successful patterns  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install cookiecutter
pip install cookiecutter

# Create a new project from the barebone template
cookiecutter gh:MoustHolmes/cookiecutter-ml-templates --directory=templates/barebone

# Or from the flow matching template
cookiecutter gh:MoustHolmes/cookiecutter-ml-templates --directory=templates/flow_matching
```
